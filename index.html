        <h2>This place is destroyed. The kingdom is at the hand of the enemy, the emperor, no my father was killed by the enemy.
            The sudden attack at midnight caught us off guard. The enemy was already at the emperor's bedroom. Asleep.
            Nobody heard him get in, let out a sound even his shadow can't be seen. Now here I am facing that enemy.
            Eye to eye. He held his sword on my neck.

            "How was the show, Young Lady?"
            
            Emotionless face on him. Huh such an emo.

            "I'm sure there's more incredible show than this." I said

            I looked at him judging.

            "Let this be the last time you sicko, i've regressed for 142 times just to watch your useless crap?"

            He seemed angry. He held his sword tightly and sliced down my head.
            
            And I woke up, the same place...
